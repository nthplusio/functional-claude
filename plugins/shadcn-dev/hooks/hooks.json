If the file doesn't exist OR `last_refresh` is more than 7 days ago:\n   - Inform the user: \"shadcn/Tailwind documentation cache is stale. Would you like me to refresh it?\"\n   - If they agree, use WebFetch to get latest docs from:\n     - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation (installation guide)\n     - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli (CLI reference)\n     - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation (Tailwind v4 installation)\n   - Update the cache file with fresh content, preserving the Learnings section\n   - Update `last_refresh` to today's date\n4. If cache is fresh (less than 7 days old), continue silently\n\nThis check ensures documentation stays current without overwhelming users with frequent refreshes."
