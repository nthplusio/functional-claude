# Planning Context Template

All modes use this structure (replace bracketed placeholders with actual interview content):

```
## Planning Context

### Objective
[What we're planning, desired end state]

### Current State
[What exists today]

### Constraints
[Non-negotiables]

### Stakeholders
[Decision makers, affected parties]

### Success Definition
[How success is measured]

### Additional Context
[Mode-specific extended question answers]

### Project Analysis
[Findings from codebase/document analysis]

### Lessons Applied
[If R5 retrospective scan returned plugin-scope improvements relevant to this spawn: 1–3 bullets from prior AAR improvement tables. Format: "Prior run found: [improvement description]." Omit this section entirely if R5 returned no data or R5 is not yet implemented.]

### Expected Outcomes
[From Expected Outcomes compilation step — Phase count, feasibility constraint, stakeholder success definition, out of scope. Omit section if user skipped or mode is not Research/Planning.]
