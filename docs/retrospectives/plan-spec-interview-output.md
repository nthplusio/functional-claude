# Retrospective: plan-spec-interview-output

## Coverage
Partially — some gaps. Important questions were addressed but some areas were missed.

## Blind Spots
Team lead should have directed it — the lead's task breakdown missed an area.

## Actionable Insights
- The lead's task descriptions were detailed but didn't prevent the Architect from overriding user gate decisions with risk findings. A future improvement: the lead should explicitly mark gate decisions as "binding — do not override" when relaying risk findings to the Architect, and add a verification step to the compilation task: "confirm spec matches all gate decisions before writing."
- The Risk Analyst had no work after task 3 — adding a cross-review task ("verify Architect's specs match risk findings") would have caught the gate override earlier and given the Risk Analyst productive post-assessment work.
