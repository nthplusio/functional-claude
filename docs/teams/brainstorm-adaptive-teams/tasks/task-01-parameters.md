# Task 1: Brainstorming Parameters and Rules of Engagement

## Problem Definition

The agent-teams plugin has 8 separate team blueprints with these pain points:
- Too many spawn commands → choice paralysis
- Small tasks get heavy teams (resource waste)
- Overlap between team types
- Context duplication across blueprints
- Verbose output

## Success Criteria

1. Ranked list of improvement ideas with trade-offs
2. Architecture proposal for top ideas

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Reducing and consolidating team types (target: 3-4 base types with sub-types)
- Adaptive model selection based on task complexity
- Token budget as primary constraint
- Evolving the persona system (not replacing it)
- Spawn command UX improvements

**Out of scope:**
- Replacing the persona system entirely
- Changes unrelated to team structure or spawn UX
- Infrastructure changes outside the plugin

## Rules of Engagement for Brainwriters

During brainwriting, all teammates must follow these rules:

1. **No criticism, no evaluation** — only "yes and" thinking
2. **Quantity over quality** — wild ideas are welcome; judgment is deferred until convergence
3. **No cross-talk during brainwriting** — ideas must be generated independently to prevent anchoring bias
4. **Minimum 8 ideas each** — volume creates option space; self-censoring is not allowed
5. **Build on others only in the building phase** — not during brainwriting

## Brainwriter Assignments

- **Brainwriter A (Visionary)** — Task 2: Generate 8-10 visionary ideas
- **Brainwriter B (Pragmatist)** — Task 3: Generate 8-10 practical ideas

## Phase Sequence

1. Setup (this task) → Brainwriting (tasks 2+3, parallel) → Collect/Cluster (task 4)
2. User feedback gate (task 5) → Building phase (tasks 6+7, parallel)
3. Convergence (task 8) → Final output (task 9)
